NBA games require detailed situational analysis.\n\nMARKET 2: NO\nReasoning: Tesla has consistently missed FSD timelines, and \"unsupervised\" (no driver attention) faces massive regulatory hurdles that cannot be resolved in ~2 months. March 31 deadline is extremely aggressive.\n\nMARKET 3: NO_TRADE\nReasoning: Without knowing the current line movement, team pace factors, injury reports, or back-to-back situations, I cannot determine if Under 232.5 offers value despite the recent sharp action.",
