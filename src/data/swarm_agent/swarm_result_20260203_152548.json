      "response": "MARKET 1: NO\nReasoning: Xi Jinping has consolidated unprecedented power in China with no credible threats to his position. A $10k bet on No reflects the extremely low probability of regime change within 5 months.\n\nMARKET 2: NO_TRADE\nReasoning: Without current form data, head-to-head records, or roster information for this specific BO5 esports match, there's insufficient edge to make an informed prediction despite the recent Leviatan trade.\n\nMARKET 3: NO_TRADE\nReasoning: Flying Tulip's token launch timeline depends on internal project decisions and crypto market conditions over 19 months. Without knowledge of their development roadmap or team commitments, this is speculative with no clear edge.",
